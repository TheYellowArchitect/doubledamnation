Having GroundCollision also interact with platforms, makes platforms more... "Magnetic"
What the obvious results are:
	1. When you jump vertically from downwards a platform, instead of fully ignoring it, when you reach its base, you will do another jump just by holding upwards.
	2. When you pass through a platform at certain angle/position, with HIGH INFLUENCE, it reduces it to 0 more or less or changes angle a lot
	3. It makes it easier to jump from it from any angle, the magnetic effect is real as it treats any part of the platform as jumpable instead of its surface.
This kills high-level play imo (but helps it in other parts...)
