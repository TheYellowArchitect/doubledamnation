If the version updates to latest, it can use ShaderGraph.
Then, git gut, and implement this: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-shader-to-dynamically-swap-a-sprites-colors--cms-25129
With it, also replace the monsters.
It saves so much space! And best of all? Users can make their own color palettes, instead of going into each sprite and manually recoloring it lmao. (not to mention that u have to replace all sprite placements for every single frame)
